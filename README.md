By doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset by Howe et al. (2015) I found that there is county-wide variation in the percentage of people who “do not know” global warming is happening in the United States and this variation is higher than the variation at the State level. I also found that the percentage of climate deniers only accounts for a 13% variation in the percentage of climate unaware population at the county level, indicating that there might be differences in predictors of climate unawareness and climate denial.
